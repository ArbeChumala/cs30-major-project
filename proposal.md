# CS30 Major Project

## Description
Samuel Wardell and Arbe Chumala plan to create a series of mini-games playable on p5.party which utilize 2d and 3d physics. This includes having multiple different elements (IE Pool balls) interacting in a manner representative of reasonable physics. These games will likely utilize a physics engine to facilitate the creation of graphics and a more enjoyable playing experience as opposed to focusing on the creation of a physics engine. 

## Needs To Have List
- Realistics physics (collisions, elasticity, friction, gravity, etc.)
- At least 1 functioning p5.party games

## Nice To Have List
- 3+ games (likely all using similar physics)
- Customizable avatars
